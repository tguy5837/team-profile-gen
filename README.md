# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This team profile generator works by first prompting the user to add the manager's name, id, email, and office number. There can only be one manager on the team, the rest of the team members will be either Engineers or Interns.

Once the user has finished adding the managers info, they will be asked to add either an Engineer or an Inter. Once a choice has been made, prompts for the corresponding employee type will be displayed. The engineer will require name, id, email, and github username while the intern will require name, id, email, and their school.

This app was created to make team organization a breeze by dynamically creating HTML based on user input.
